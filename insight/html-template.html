<div class="body mb80">".$date."In 2018, <a href="#">Bending Spoons</a> switched from Sketch to Figma. We evaluated the benefits and the reasons behind the change. Now Figma allows us to work in a faster and simpler way with developers and also teams not directly involved in the specific design process.</div>
		
		<h2>Starting from Figma</h2>
		<div class="body mb80">With Figma, we radically improved how we deliver assets and design guidelines to developers. Collaborating with other designers and developers in real-time is the key to a fast and robust design process. This process allows us to fix and optimize user experience and user interface on the way and to receive quick and precise feedback.</div>
		
		<h2>Internal Documentation Library</h2>
		<div class="body mb25">We regularly use comments on Figma, which is an easy way to give and receive feedback directly linked to screens and components.</div>
		<div class="body mb80">To boost this process, we released an internal library with useful elements that allow us to attach comments and links (to a prototype, animation, or asset) below a screen or a flow. Developers will have all the links and specs right there without asking for any resource or UX behavior.</div>
		<h2>Extracting styles automatically</h2>
		<div class="body mb80">Our support tools team developed a Plugin, which allows the developers to directly extract and immediately work on styles data from Figma. With this process in mind, we have more rules to follow to prevent issues while developing the product.</div>
		
		<h2>P3 Gamut optimization</h2>
		<div class="body mb80">Unfortunately, at this moment, Figma still doesn’t let designers export images using a P3 profile. Therefore we also created a useful internal tool to allow designers, and even developers to convert fast exported images from RGB to P3. It’s a simple AppleScript that uses ImageOptim and ImageMagick libraries.</div>
