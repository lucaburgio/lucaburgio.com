    Over the years I pass through different teams, different design processes and I saw many different ways to interact with the users, collect their feedback, and create many iterations of a design based on those feedbacks. I wrote down ideas, sketches, opinions, and rules that I learned about user experience, product, and interaction design.

<div class="parallax" id="scene">
    <div style="-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 14px 18px -6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
-moz-box-shadow: 0px 14px 18px -6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
box-shadow: 0px 14px 18px -6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);background-color: #000;" class="bg" data-depth="0.3"></div>
    <div class="item" data-depth="0.7" style="background-image:url(assets/visuals/an-introduction-to-insight-01.png);"></div>
</div>

<p>
Then, after several years, during the Covid-19 lockdown, I finally decided to start making order of these ideas and notes and to publish them in a personal collection, accessible by everyone.
</p>
<p>
The name of this little project is Insight. This will not be a classic blog, no, I never liked blogs, too many, and a lot of them speaking about the same topics, exceptions apart of course.
</p>
<p>
So, the main goal of this agenda (If we want to call it like this) will be to share ideas, opinions, and knowledge earned through the years about macro topics like User Experience, Interaction Design, and Product Design.

I hope youâ€™ll like it, and of course, feel free to get in touch with me on Twitter if you want to share your idea or thought. It will be very helpful for me and why not, maybe a starting point for a new article.
